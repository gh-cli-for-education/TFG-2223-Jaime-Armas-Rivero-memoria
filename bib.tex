\maketitle

Using \texttt{biblatex} you can display a bibliography divided 
into sections, depending on citation type. Let's cite! Einstein's 
journal paper \cite{einstein} and Dirac's book \cite{dirac} are 
physics-related items. Next, \textit{The \LaTeX\ Companion} book
 \cite{latexcompanion}, Donald Knuth's website \cite{knuthwebsite},
\textit{The Comprehensive Tex Archive Network} (CTAN) 
\cite{ctan} are \LaTeX-related items; but the others, Donald Knuth's items, 
\cite{knuth-fa,knuth-acp} are dedicated to programming.
